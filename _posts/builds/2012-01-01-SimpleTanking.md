intro: >
  <p>
    For race Argonian is really good for resource management (drinking a potion gives an additional 4k resources).
    Nord is best in slot at the moment giving health, resistances and ultimate regeneration.
    Imperial in my opinion is the worst race at the moment but it gives you resources and health every few seconds when attacking.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a simple gear setup to be extremely tanky you can go with Plague Doctor, Fortified Brass and Blood Spawn.
    If you're fresh out of CP 160 you can go with Plague Doctor (Purchasable) and Whitestrake's Retribution (Craftable).
  </p>
  <p>
    For the glyphs and traits you'll want to be looking for is to go health glyphs on everything. 
    6 Body pieces sturdy and then 1 piece reinforced (Chest/Head/legs).
    For jewellery go for 3 magicka recovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the weapon enchant changes with Wrathstone the best options is to go decisive with a absorb stamina glyph and then on the back bar a ice/lightning staff infused with a crusher enchant (use elemental blockade to proc this).
    But using a destruction staff is a little more for experienced tanks so if you don't feel comfortable then you can go for infused crusher front bar and infused weapon weakening back bar one handed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then for a simple explanation on how to tank: First off is when going into a fight try to Inner Fire enemies at the back or HIGH priority enemies first then switch to your front bar quick to taunt the front enemies, when you've done this Choking Talons the enemies that are on top of you, at this point you can start looking around for enemies to chain pull to you and try to keep Choking Talons the enemy so that they won't move for the DPS.
  </p>
  <p>
  For boss fights always turn the boss to the opposite side from where you are coming from (opposite of your allies) and never move from that spot.
  </p>

extra: >
  <p>
    The Atronach Mundus Stone is really good to use more abilities more often, there is one in Firerocky111 primary residence its our guild house with everything you'll need.
  </p>
  <p>
    64 points in health, Tri Stat food like Longfin Pastry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also having Vampire is pretty good to have giving you more resource regeneration and a massive damage reduction when at low health.
