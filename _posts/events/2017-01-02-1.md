description: "The long awaited continuation of the adventure is going to get started. With some fresh blood joining the group. This event is only for the people that have been accepted into the group already. Looking to join a group? Read on! :D

Are you looking to participate in a Dungeons and Dragons group? Be sure to send a direct message to @Azpet or have a look at the #dungeons-and-dragons text channel for other people that might be looking for a group. (BTW if you can't see the text channel go to #info-and-ranks and click on the D20 reaction on the \"Role Menu: Games\" message.) Don't be afraid because you don't know how it works or if you never played it. We have some people that are happy to teach you the rules and help you get started. Veterans to (tabletop) roleplaying are of course also welcome!"
