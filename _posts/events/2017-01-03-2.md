description: "<em>Summerset chapter required.</em>
After last week Azpet is still looking for some Olorime's Lightning Staff so he will be doing some more runs. Same routine as last time. It's a short trial with some great loot for almost everyone like Siroria, Olorime, Relequen and Galenwe. We're not expected to get a full group in, but if you want to join be sure to let (@Azpet#9592) know by direct message so he can make sure to invite you when it is time.

Any one is welcome for this event (at least cp 160)."
