description: "<em>Summerset chapter required.</em> 
Azpet is looking for some Olorime's Staves (healing and lightning) so let's get a couple of Normal Cloudrest runs in! It's a short trial with some great loot for almost everyone like Siroria, Olorime, Relequen and Galenwe. We're not expected to get a full group in, but if you want to join be sure to let (@Azpet) know by direct message so he can make sure to invite you when it is time.

Any one is welcome for this event (at least cp 160)"
