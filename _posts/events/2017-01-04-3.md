description: "We will have an all out war between the 3 alliances.<br>
People with the most amount of members will have to defend a keep that is on the edge of the connected paths and the 2 other alliance will have to capture the keep for Mephala!<br>
Work together or face each other on the field of combat for Mephala.<br><br>

If this is popular we can switch the defenders afterwards."
